# Stochastics Overview

This repository contains **Stochastics Overview**, a concise summary of key topics in probability theory and statistics, compiled in `stochastics-overview.pdf`. The document is written in **Typst**, a modern typesetting system similar to LaTeX, designed for intuitive and fast document creation.

## üìñ About the Document

The **Stochastics Overview** is a reference guide covering essential concepts such as:

- **Probability Spaces**: Definitions, axioms, and basic properties.
- **Random Variables**: Discrete and continuous variables, probability mass/density functions.
- **Expectation & Variance**: Properties, linearity, and key theorems.
- **Common Distributions**: Binomial, Poisson, Normal, and others with practical examples.
- **Law of Large Numbers & Central Limit Theorem**: Intuitive explanations with illustrations.
- **Markov Chains**: Transition matrices, steady-state behavior, and real-world applications.

Each section includes clear explanations and **examples** to illustrate concepts.
